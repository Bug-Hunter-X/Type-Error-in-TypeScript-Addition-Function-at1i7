# Type Error in TypeScript
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.

## Description
The `bug.ts` file contains a function `add` that is designed to add two numbers. However, it is called with strings, leading to a type error that is caught during compilation.  The `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix the error using type guards or type assertions (use with caution!).

## How to run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the TypeScript files using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).  This will highlight the error in `bug.ts`.
3. Review `bugSolution.ts` to see the solution.
